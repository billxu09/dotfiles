Collection of Jamie Wong's dotfiles (mostly vim stuff)

Usage
-----

To install this, clone the repo then run `make` in the root directory.

This will ink `.vimrc` and `.vim` (it won't overwrite yours if they already exist).

If you want to use the `.bash_profile` on top of yours, you can add

    source path/to/dotfiles/.bash_profile

to the top of your real `.bash_profile` or `.bashrc`
